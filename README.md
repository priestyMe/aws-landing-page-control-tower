# AWS Landing Page with Terraform

## Project Overview

This project sets up an AWS Landing Page using Terraform, following best practices and the AWS Well-Architected Framework. It automates the deployment of core AWS resources, including VPC, EC2 instances, and S3 buckets, while ensuring governance and security principles are applied.

## Features

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform
- AWS resources setup: VPC, EC2 instances, and S3
- Automated CI/CD deployment with GitHub Actions
- Integration with AWS IAM for secure access management

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account
- AWS CLI configured on your local machine
- Terraform installed on your local machine
- Git installed on your local machine
- A GitHub repository for version control

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd aws-landing-page
```

### Setup GitHub Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository settings under **Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions**:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` (Your private SSH key)
- `AWS_KEY_NAME` (The name of the key pair)
- `INSTANCE_TYPE` (e.g., `t2.micro`)
- `AMI_ID` (The ID of the AMI to use)
- `AWS_REGION` (e.g., `ap-southeast-2`)
- `SSH_IP` (Your public IP for SSH access)

### Update Variables

Modify the `variables.tf` file as necessary to suit your requirements.

### Running the Workflow

1. **Create a new branch for your changes**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-branch
   ```

2. **Make changes to the Terraform files** and commit them:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

3. **Push the changes to your GitHub repository**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-branch
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** to merge your changes into the `main` branch.

### GitHub Actions

The workflow is triggered on pull requests to the `main` branch. It performs the following steps:

- Initializes Terraform
- Validates Terraform configurations
- Plans changes based on the current state
- Applies changes only when merged into the `main` branch

## Conclusion

This project serves as a foundational setup for building and deploying an AWS Landing Page while leveraging Infrastructure as Code principles. Feel free to customize and expand upon this project to meet your needs.
